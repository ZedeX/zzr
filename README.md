# Hello my girl!

You have no idea how exciting I am when you were born.

My life had changed since then.

The moment when you mom called me that she was labored in her tiny weak voice after 9 hours in the labor room, I was calm. But later when I saw your face, I laughed.

"She got so many born hair!" All nurses and midwives say this when they saw you.

Your eyes opened just several hours later. Even they just a little chink, but they are much more eariler than other babies who would open their eyes several days after born.

Your cry sound small, not like the baby boy next room. Your cry is weak. And I was worried about your vocalis.

Your legs were agile and always gave others side kicks time to time.

Your little fingers were always grasp all things in or near your hands.

You was lucky because you got milk to eat just after you born.

Your mom and I, and all relatives wish you a cheerful, meaningful, hopeful jouney with us.

Good luck, my girl!
